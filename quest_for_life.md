## Scene 1

Roof

You are on the roof of the Life Science Building. It is raining. How did you get here?

You try the door to the stairwell. It is locked.

You have a feeling that by answering some basic maths problems the door might open. You can't explain why you feel this. But you know it to be true.

Success. The door opens. You decend to the 3rd floor corridor.
